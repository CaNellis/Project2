# Project2 Description
 
## Topic Selection:
We decided to use a previous dataset from project 1 and visualize it in a more effective and user-friendly way. 
- Dataset = Age-Adjusted Death Rates for 10 Leading Causes of Death in United States over 17 years [(link to dataset)](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/NCHS-Leading-Causes-of-Death-United-States/bi63-dtpu) The dataset provides age-adjusted death rates for the 10 leading causes of death in the United States (by state) from the years 1999-2016.
- Original Variables:  
1. Years: 1999-2016
2. Causes of Death: Top 10 Causes of death classified by the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICDâ€“10) and ranked according to the number of deaths assigned to rankable causes (based on the underlying cause of death)
3. State: U.S. State
4. Number of Deaths: based on resident death certificates filed 
5. Age-Adjusted Death Rate (per 100,000 people)
 
## Data Cleaning:
In jupyter notbeook, we limited our dataset to: only the U.S. as a whole (remove state variable) and to follow-up on a subset of the original dataset using some of the analysis completed in Project 1. 
 
## Visualization:
For our final visualization, we created an interactive dashboard using a Python Flask powered RESTful API,  HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and csv data. 

### Line Chart (created with plotly js) = 
- chosen to allow user to more interactively compare causes of death over time, replaces the need for numerous static charts in Project 
- features: user can select which of the 10 causes to appear on the line graph and user can view specific values upon hover 

### Stacked Bar Chart (using highlights js) =
- we originally created a pie and bar chart to allow users to see the distribution of percentages for a specific year, with a dropdown option to change years. Thus, they would be more efficient than multiple static pie and bar charts. 
- However, the stacked bar was ultimately chosen to replace them because it allows the user to compare multiple years' distribution of percentages in one glance (aka: it combined what both of the charts were showing).
- features: user can view specific values upon hover
